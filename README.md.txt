Program contains the exercises from the Algebra C# course, along with the navigation menu made from scratch. After the exercise is executed, you can repeat the exercise or go back to the list of exercises.

Each menu option is an object with the appropriate sub menu linked to it. If you enter a sub menu it calls the Menu method again with the list of submenu options. When you go back, it ends the current method in the recursion. Each menu option name is loaded from a CSV file.

When you enter the last submenu in the navigation menu it executes the assosiated method, which contains the exercise description and implementation.

The project was made to better understand some of the C# concepts not covered in the course, to get familiar with Git and Github, and to practice my English writing.
